<h4>What are the most important aspects of quality software?</h4>

There are many factors to consider when developing software that will lead to the end product being successful. Maintainability and readability are an important asspect of software development, easily maintainable and readable code make for future changes/updates to software much simpler for the developers so they can push out updates with minimal errors/conflicts. performance and efficency of software is also a key asspect of a successful application, the software must be quick in the task it is performing if it is to slow users wont  like to use it. The software must also be resource efficient by not requiring to much disk space and not using to much processing power users should be able to use the application simultaniously while doing other task on their computer. Usability and accsessability are the next aspect of software development on this list, all aplications must be simple and easy to use a user should be able to pick up the use/navagation of the application quickly and intuitively. The software should also be accessible by users with disabilites eg: a blind user should be able to tab though the entire application and the voice reading application they use should give accurate reading of the diffent aspects of the site. The application must be compatible with range of diffent operating systems and if it is a web application it must compatible accross all if not most web browsers. Security is the one of them most important factors of software developement and must be taken seriously. authorisation and authentication is a must for any software that stores any potentialy confidential data the only people that should have accses to the back end of the application is the devs, also the data must be encrypted for securtiy.
