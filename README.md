This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

<h2>Short Answer Questions</h2>


<h4>What are the most important aspects of quality software?</h4>

There are many factors to consider when developing software that will lead to the end product being successful. Maintainability and readability are an important asspect of software development, easily maintainable and readable code make for future changes/updates to software much simpler for the developers so they can push out updates with minimal errors/conflicts. performance and efficency of software is also a key asspect of a successful application, the software must be quick in the task it is performing if it is to slow users wont  like to use it. The software must also be resource efficient by not requiring to much disk space and not using to much processing power users should be able to use the application simultaniously while doing other task on their computer. Usability and accsessability are the next aspect of software development on this list, all aplications must be simple and easy to use a user should be able to pick up the use/navagation of the application quickly and intuitively. The software should also be accessible by users with disabilites eg: a blind user should be able to tab though the entire application and the voice reading application they use should give accurate reading of the diffent aspects of the site. The application must be compatible with range of diffent operating systems and if it is a web application it must compatible accross all if not most web browsers. Security is the one of them most important factors of software developement and must be taken seriously. authorisation and authentication is a must for any software that stores any potentialy confidential data the only people that should have accses to the back end of the application is the devs, also the data must be encrypted for securtiy.


<h4>What libraries are being used in the app and why?</h4>

passport
passport is used for authentication on the back end

express ACl
express ACl is used of the authorisation of the back end of the application

<h4>A team is about to engage in a project, developing a website for a small business. What knowledge and skills would they need in order to develop the project?</h4>

soft skills 
they must be able to communicate with their client effectvivly and understand the task the the client is presenting them.

effctively communicate with each other as a team.

Use jira /trello to manage who is working on what at each given time so that the devs dont work over the top of each other 

technical skills
proffiecent in the use of their chosen tech stack
document every aspect of the projects
git workflow controll
user testing / automated testing 
security measures taken to protect user data.

<h4>Within your own project what knowledge or skills were required to complete your project, and overcome challenges?</h4>

soft skills 
communicate with client regulary and get their approval of new features and updates
communication amongst the dev team daily, eg: working in person together and stand up in the morning to disscus work done the day prior and the planned to get done today.
code reviews of each team members work


technical skills 
proficient use of the mern stack
Use git effectivley raise and merge pull request
trello to track task 
slack to communicate


<h4>Evaluate how effective your knowledge and skills were this project, using examples, and suggest changes or improvements for future projects of a similar nature?</h4>
